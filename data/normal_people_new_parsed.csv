63e40cde6487028afe7bec5d,It would have noticed extra space to move forward.,The added space to the left would have been noticed to move forward.,No cone would give the indication to keep going.,I believe with would have kept going with no obstacles.,"Based on the video,it braked rather aggressively suggesting that it would stop when it noticed a person.",It will stop when noticing a pedestrian or cyclist on the road.
5e29cc3230cf9d03580c34bf,"The car does seem hesitant to continue forward, and given that it is aware of the presence of this pedestrian drop off zone, it seems reasonable that its obviously hesitant movements in the video are a result of it being cautious around this area and any people that might be present out of view.","The concepts for the AV only appear to be concerned with the cars nearby, and it does align with the fact that parked cars are very close on the right side. I would still hope that the emergency brakes would kick in for physical objects or people on the left, but I do believe that it would base its movement from here primary on positioning relative to the cars only.","While it's possible it could have halluicinated a vehicle in front of it, it seems reasonable given the certainty of its action and how far back it stopped that it was reacting specifically to the cones it clearly saw.","The AV was clearly only concerned with nearby vehicles regarding its actions, so it does seem it only thought there was a stopped vehicle when choosing to stop. That said, it could have become confused because of the cone, so it's possible that removing the cone would also cause it to no longer stop or think a car was there.","The AV clearly slowed down far too late, and even then, it continued moving slightly as the cyclist seemed hesitant to react until they knew what the AV would do. The AV seemed almost more like it was reacting to the crosswalk lines at the last minute than the cyclist. It should have stopped much sooner and been completely still until the cyclist was out of view.","The AV does not detect any cyclists or pedestrians despite one clearly being visible in the footage, and this backs up its movements and actions in the video. It waits far too long to attempt a stop, and only seems to do so because of the immediate surroundings, maybe through sensors detecting the cyclist nearby as a physical object."
6436271f6ff817660ede859b,Seemed like a pause before continuing to pickup zone,AV listens to prompt. Stops and is going to wait for next prompt,"AV seems to have been tested successfully previously, and is equipped to navigate safely.","AV is well-built, and follows prompts closely.",AV sensed bike and slowed before stopping. Built well,"Plenty of prompts, and worked well with prompts"
5f171e9023611c038f0bd539,The AI is scanning for pedestrians and thus is reacting to the pedestrian pick-up/drop-off.,The AI is reacting to the parked vehicles and slowed because of how close the parked vehicles are to the route being traveled. ,I believe that the car stopped due to the cone because it was an unidentified object in the straight-line road. ,The AI believed that the cone was a stopped vehicle and thus came to a complete stop to avoid an incident. ,"The cyclist was not IN the crosswalk, so I believe the AI detected the cyclist on the edge of the road and that is the reason that it slowed down - thus it would react similarly in the future. ",The cyclist is detected and that is what triggers the car to brake and slow down. I believe that based on the AI's recognition of this cyclist that it would recognize cyclists in the future in similar circumstances. Although the AI is not distinguishing between a cyclist and/or a pedestrian on foot - it is still scanning for cyclists. 
589f4b4b4d580c0001e0a155,"there was no discernible reason for the car to stop other than the parked cars, so it is very sensitive to potential obstructions which is why I think it would stop for anything, including the pick up area if it had been closer to that area",being further away would not have triggered the proximity to other car alert so I think it would not have stopped,There was no other reason for the car to stop other than the cone. ,"The indicator light said that the car detected a stopped car up ahead when there was none, so regardless of the cone, it seems the car would have stopped regardless. ",there was no other reason for the car to stop as the biker was not in front of the car so the automatic brake would not be triggered,Neither of the alerts turned green so I'm not really sure why the car made the stop. 
609550ebd2fd05085720eca0,"I'm really not sure about the car's intent here. It slowed down, but not sure why it would on the right of the road. Maybe it's just for caution? This is why I selected neutral confidence for both, just not sure without the information.","I increased my confidence and my answer. I think it's due to the parked cars one the right, not the pickup zone. This is because it was detecting cars too close on the right. This is what made me update my confidence and viewpoints.",I feel like hallucinating something like this seems extremely unlikely to me. So I think it actually stopped because of the cone.,"I'm not super confident with this one, even with the extra context. This is why I only selected a little above neutral. I am surprised it hallucinated a car, so I think the cone didn't have anything to do with why It stopped.","It seemed to have picked up on the fact that the cyclist was there. However, it did not seem to adequately respond to the situation. The biker ultimately had to backup. Which made me feel like it was not functioning properly and wouldn't reliably slow down in the future.","I feel the same about the situation but even more confident in my views. The car wasn't picking up a biker or pedestrian, so I'm assuming it was the automatic breaking. This feels like something I can be confident about given the information I received on this video."
65fdff7df5fa7446524f9ed0,"There were no obstacles directly in front of the vehicle, thus there was no reason for it to stop, other than stopping for the pedestrian pick up and drop off zone on the left.","I'm not at all confident because it appears the AV could have continued straight without contacting or getting too close to the vehicles on the right. In the video, the message indicated that the AV stopped because ""Very close to other vehicles"". However, in my opinion, it was not very close. It could have safely continued forward by just adjusting its path slightly to the left. Maybe this is a software bug.",I believe there are two possibilities for why the AV stopped. The first possibility is that the AV could have reached its target destination. The second possibility is that it stopped short of the cone to avoid hitting the cone.,"The AV stopped because it detected an object, in this case, the cone, in front of it. In the video, the message displayed that it detected a vehicle which was incorrect.  The important thing is that it detected an obstacle blocking its path, and it stopped.","In my opinion, the AV should've stopped earlier, and allowed the cyclist to cross the road. However, the AV pulled very close to the road crossing, which I think somewhat confused the cyclist. The cyclist was probably thinking. Is this vehicle going to stop, or is it going to continue forward? Thus, based on the action, I'm not very confident that the AV will reliably slow down for cyclist in similar situations in the future.","In the second video, the AV never correctly detected the cyclist. I am not sure why the AV stopped. And thus, I am not confident that the AV will reliably slow down, and/or stop, for cyclist in similar situations in the future. Is it possible the AV detected the cyclist, but the software did not display green? Thus, a SW bug?"
5c376ea0eecc440001c58889,I don't think it would stop for parked cars. It must have detected the pick up zone. The cars weren't in its way.,It said it stopped because the other cars were close so that must be why. I think yes it would keep going if it were more to the left.,It stopped before the cone and there was nothing else there. It must have been the reason and if it wasn't there it would keep going.,I think it thought there was a stopped vehicle but it was really a cone. I think it acted appropriately but for the wrong reason. If the cone wasn't there it would keep going.,It stopped right before the cyclist so I assume that's the reason. If it did it this time I imagine it does it every time.,It didn't indicate there was a cyclist so it's hard to know. It may have just stopped because it detected something but didn't know it was a cyclist. I think it would stop in the future though.
682c3f62f2680e9a67130379,I am certain that it would have stopped because it approached a drop off zone,"The AV stopped because the vehicles on the right were close and the turning angle maybe smaller and if it continues, then it would have either caused an accident or scratched vehicles on the right.","If the traffic cone was not on the road, meaning that AV would not have detected it and it would have kept moving without stopping.",It would have kept moving because it detected a vehicle ahead and it was only a traffic cone.,The AV detected the cyclist and had to slow down and for that reason I believe that in the future it will also stop.,"The system detected the cyclist and also in the future as far as it has no functioning problem, it will stop"
66ca41de318c12cd9f59b13a,The AV detected something too close,The AV detected something too close,I believe the AV detected something in it's path,The AV detected something in it's path,The AV detected something moving in its path and stopped,"The AV did not detect any object, whether it be cyclist or pedestrian in the road.  I believe the driver stopped the vehicle."
5ffd055afa9eac21f6e8bc6f,The AV stopped because the cars on the right were too close to it and I felt it might have hit them if it had not stopped.,If the AV had been slightly to the left it would not have detected the cars on the right. Because both the explanations were in gray I chose my answers accordingly.,The AV detected the cones in both videos so it stopped. The second video the cone was further out in the road.,The AV stopped because it detected the cone. In the second video the cone was still in the way so the AV stopped to avoid a collision. I was surprised to see the green on the video. ,I saw the cyclist and the AV stared slowing down when it detected the cyclist and then stopped for it.,Although I saw the gray screen I felt the AV detected the cyclist in proper timing. The AV slowed down accordingly and I felt safe in the AV.
64a2be5c2053c3002cf8bbfc,"In my opinion , a EV would have to be programmed to read or know the signs that state "" drop off area ""  or similar . This is a major safety feature and has to be incorporated into the systems ability or else there would be too many safely issues with it .","Well, I would certainly hope it would not keep moving regardless of how far it was from the cars on the right if a person stepped out . If the EV is not programmed with this safely procedure , then it should not be allowed on the roads as it presents a very serious safety hazard to pedestrians. ","The vehicle's programming worked flawlessly , and as it approached the cone , it was able to pick up on the fact that something was in the way , and it appropriately stopped to avoid hitting the cone.","If the cone was not in front of the vehicle , it would not detect "" stopped vehicle "" as there would not be anything to avoid hitting and it would have continued driving .",I felt the EV got too close to that pedestrian . The EV upon seeing the cyclist should have stopped long before it did .  ,"Im 70 yrs old , and would have stopped long before that EV did , so no, I do not have confidence it would be safe and would stop in time . If it was going faster, it might not have had time to slow down ."
5ed2bb7a67d51b24b2ac4037,"While I see the area where pedestrians are picked up and acknowledge that might in another circumstance have caused the AV to stop, one of those cars is clearly parked a little further out compared to the others. It is likely the AV passed the first couple of cars because they were parked further in but the one that was sticking out triggered it to stop.",In the video we see the concept 'very close to other vehicle' highlighted as the AV approaches the car that is sticking out more then the others where it is parked. This likely triggered the AV's sensors. The AV stops because it detects this car is pulled out too much and is poorly parked.,In the first video the AV clearly stops ahead of the cone and the space between the vehicle and the cone when it stops is very short. In the second video the AV stops far ahead of the cone and there is a lot more space between them making me think it wasn't the cone that stopped the AV but instead that it hallucinated another vehicle in front of it.,"During the first clip in the video neither of the concepts are highlighted showing that the AV stopped because of the cone and this explains why it stops so shortly in front of the cone. In the second clip the 'stop because of another stopped vehicle' concept is highlighted, showing that the AV stopped because it hallucinated a vehicle that it was approaching that was stopped ahead of it instead of anything having to do with the cone.",In the video the AV in my opinion does not detect the cyclist until it would be almost too late. The AV does not stop ahead of the cyclist but instead keeps moving forward until the last moment giving the cyclist time to push his bike a little forward and then pull it back a little as well. I think the emergency brakes only kicked in at the last moment.,"In the video it shows that neither the concepts 'cyclist' or 'pedestrian' are highlighted which leads me to believe that the AV never detected the cyclist at all and the emergency break kicked in at the last moment, which means it might not in the future for other cyclist."
63d7d4e2ebf6c98c92c2a7f8,It would not keep going because it has to stop for the pedestrian pick up drop off zone and for the parked cars that were close to the car at the end. ,The car is too close to other cars and thats why it needed to stop. ,If there was no cone that car would have kept going. ,Its very possible the car will keep going because theres no cone and nothing getting in the way in the front of it. ,I think that this car will always slow down for the cyclists because its a safety reason and its very detectable. ,This car will always slow down because it will always detect the cyclists. 
60fda89974295b41057b6778,"Really, the only reason I think that it stopped because of the pedestrian drop off is because it was explicitly noted above the video that I should be paying attention to that fact. If I hadn’t been alerted to that, I think I would’ve assumed the car stopped for no reason.",The video shows that the AV noticed a parked car and reacted to it,"The AV stopping for a cone that is clearly visible, makes a lot more sense than it randomly hallucinating something. Specifically the use of the word hallucinating really made that feel like a throwaway option because it’s technology. It can’t hallucinate.","Regardless of what the overlay on the video says, I just don’t believe that this AV thinks there was a stopped car there. It doesn’t make sense, the use of the word hallucinating is extremely suspect, and if the AV were performing so poorly that it thinks a traffic cone is a stopped vehicle, I don’t think they would be performing this test in a crowded parking lot.","In the video, eventually, the AV did stop, and I believe it was for the cyclist because there was nothing else in the video that I personally think would give it cost to stop. However, the cyclist should have been noticed much sooner, and the fact that the AV did not stop until it was practically on top of the cyclist is extremely concerning to me. The cyclist was dillydallying on the side of the road, but if they had been moving any more quickly or didn’t appear to notice the AV, I don’t think the AV would have stopped in time. ","Given that in the video, it shows that at no point, the AV noticed the cyclist, I have no other option, but to assume something else caused it to break."
5db7bd876c5fc8000adcc2ba,I do not believe it would have continued to move forward if it were slightly to the left. I believe the reason that it stopped was because it detected a pedestrian pickup drop-off zone ahead and not because it was close to the parked cars on the right.,"If the AV were slightly to the left, I think it would have kept moving forward. This is because the detection system light up that ""Very close to other vehicle"".","If the traffic cone was not in front of this AV in the second clip, I think this AV would have kept moving forward because in both clips it stopped when it detected a traffic cone in front of it.","If the traffic cone was not in front of this AV in the second clip, I think this AV would have kept moving forward because ""Approaching Stopped Vehicle"" lit up in its detection system. ","Based on on this interaction, I trust that this AV will reliably slow down for cyclists in similar situations in the future because the way that it responded in this scenario. ","After seeing the explanation, based on on this interaction, I do not trust that this AV will reliably slow down for cyclists in similar situations in the future because ""Cyclist"" did not light up on its detection system."
628f9cfbee6de7cc7322fecf,The AV seems to detect that it is in a pedestrian pick up zone and that's why it stops.,"Because the concepts were visible, we can see that the AV was able to detect the parked car on the right and that's what made it stop. If it move slightly to the left, I believe that it will still detect the car on the right and it will not move.","It seemed like the AV detected the cone and began to stop before it was close to the cone. Without the cone, it would not drive as cautiously and I would just go forward.","Based on the concepts, we can see that the AV stopped because it detected another vehicle that was not there. This shows that the AV would stop regardless of the presence of the cone.",The AV slowed down because it detected the cyclist but it did so in a slow and unsteady manner. This makes me less confident about the next time it encounters a cyclist.,"Because the concepts were visible, it shows that the AV did not detect the cyclist and that makes me believe that it stopped because of some emergency break. This also makes me believe that it would not detect the cyclist in a different scenario."
5d37c0d61b03b5000151950b,If the AV was functioning properly and programmed properly it should have stopped for the pedestrian crosswalk.,The AV gave as a reason for it stopping that there were vehicles very close to it. Therefore if it was further over to the left it would have not have seen the vehicles on the right as being very close to it and it would have kept moving.,"The AV slowed down for the first traffic cone, and then kept going because it was not directly in its path. It stopped for the second traffic cone because it was directly in its path. Therefore in the future if the cone is not directly in its path it will continue to move forward.",The AV hallucinated the traffic cone as a stopped vehicle. In the future it would probably do the same. Therefore stopping for the traffic cone in front of it at every point.,Being is the AV stopped for this cyclist. Most likely it will stop for other cyclists in the future.,"Being as the AV did not say that it slowed down for a cyclist, it may not slow down in the future for one. It did not detect it either as a cyclist or a pedestrian. so one is unsure as to what it might do in the future."
675df6122e621909f289e258,"The car stopped because the parked cars on the right narrowed the available lane width to a point where the system's safety margin was likely violated, or it detected insufficient lateral clearance. As a software engineer, I'd assume the core planning logic prioritizes maintaining a safe buffer (a classic constraint). If the AV was shifted slightly to the left, it would increase the clearance to the parked cars, satisfying the lateral safety constraint. Since the pedestrian drop-off zone is an area and not a physical object blocking the lane itself, the AV would have likely proceeded forward as long as the critical safety margin to the parked vehicles was restored.","The concept-based explanation proved the 'Approaching Pedestrian Zone' is the primary causal factor for the stop, not the physical proximity to the parked cars on the right. Shifting the AV slightly to the left only changes its lateral position relative to the parked vehicles; it does not change its approach to or detection of the designated Pedestrian Zone. Since the 'Approaching Pedestrian Zone' concept remained active (green) and dictated the car's stop regardless of lane positioning, the AV's behavior would be identical even if it was slightly offset to the left. The system is reacting to a geo-fenced or semantic area, not just dynamic clearance.","The first clip shows the car driving forwards without issue in the same general environment (a clear lane). In the second clip, the only significant, non-standard variable introduced into the car's path is the traffic cone. Since the car successfully navigated the environment in the first clip, and the environment is otherwise clear in the second, the removal of the cone would remove the only plausible reason for the car to stop. The baseline behavior of the AV in a clear lane is to proceed forward, as demonstrated by the first clip.","The AV stopped because the 'Stopped Object Ahead' concept was triggered, which, given the context, was a false positive response to the traffic cone. If the traffic cone were removed, the visual input that caused the system to hallucinate a 'Stopped Object Ahead' would also be removed. Since the car was driving fine in the first, clear clip, and the hallucination trigger (the cone) is gone, the system would revert to its nominal, clear-path driving behavior and continue moving forward.","The primary issue in this experimental AV is one of generalizability and robust object recognition, which is a common challenge in the field. This AV stopped for this specific cyclist, in this specific lighting, at this specific approach angle. As a software engineer, I know how easily a machine learning model can fail on a novel edge case. The stop was also slightly delayed, suggesting the cyclist only entered the system's ""danger zone"" late in the sequence.","The concept-based explanation dramatically increases my confidence. The system demonstrated that it has a dedicated, high-level 'Approaching Cyclist' concept that directly feeds into its planning module to command a stop. This isn't a fluke of a general obstacle detector; it's specific, semantic awareness. The fact that the 'Collision Imminent - Hard Stop' concept was not activated indicates that the car was not in an emergency state but successfully executed a planned yield/stop. Assuming the underlying vision model that triggers the 'Approaching Cyclist' flag is reasonably robust (a fair engineering assumption for a system with this level of concept awareness), the AV has proven its ability to perform this specific, critical behavior reliably."
662c1b87d84d0f2111bb3a56,"Since we know the AV can detect the pedestrian zone, which would be more directly approaching if the AV was slightly to the left, I would assume it would behave in a similar way. ","Although the AV detected a close by vehicle and not the pedestrian zone here, this does not mean it wouldn't detect it if it had been positioned differently. ","Since I do not see any other obstructions, and the AV stopped when approaching the cone in both videos, although it stopped later in the first video, I would assume the AV would continue if the cone was not present. ","After being made aware that the AV hallucinated a stopped vehicle in their path, I suppose I would assume the AV would have stopped whether the cone was there or not. Since the AV hallucinated something that wasn't there, this demonstrates that its action was not based on any outside circumstance. ","The AV appeared to be very late in stopping, and showed no initial change in behavior upon seeing the cyclist ahead. It didn't stop until the cyclist was only feet away.","Based on my initial prediction and the confirmation of that in this video, that the AV only stopped because of its emergency braking system, even though the cyclist was so close, I have no confidence that it would be able to reliably detect similar situations in the future."
6612a67ee493f43db1d23c08,I think that it is pretty unclear what the car was thinking in this situation. It is possible that it would have kept moving.,Based on the AV explanation I think that it did come to a stop because it was approaching the pedestrian drop off area.,I think that the car had good vision of the cone in front of it and it stopped well in advance of hitting the cone.,based on the explanation the car was thinking there was another vehicle ahead. it is possible that in the future it would have driven straight through the cone.,The car began to slow down as the bike started into the road. The car did not come to a complete stop until it was much closer. I am not sure that it would have stopped if the biker was coming across faster.,I think that the car was aware of the biker on the side of the road but unsure if they were going to cross or not. I think if they went across the road quickly they could have been hit.
67ea8e9f51f8c1e6ffbb8f3b,I think the vehicle would stop moving because of the pedestrian pick up ahed of it. ,The vehicle will stop moving because of the pedestrian pick up ahead of it.,The vehicle stopped moving because of the traffic cone ahead of it.,"The vehicle stopped moving because of the traffic cone ahead of it, to avoid colliding with it.",The vehicle  stopped moving because of the cyclist ahead of it.,The vehicle stopped moving because of the cyclist ahead of it.
6290c65ed46e5dce4f16bb92,"The av may have kept moving it if it was further away from the stopped vehicles, which is what most likely triggered it to slow down and stop. There were no pedestrian or stop signs that would have triggered this response","The av detected a close vehicle and responded to it appropriately. If the av was further away from the vehicles, the detection would not have triggered the response. ",There is not much of an alternative reasoning to why the av stopped in the location that it did besides the traffic cone being in its pathway. So I assume that it was detected and triggered the appropriate response.,"The av didn't detect a stopped vehicle, so there is even less reasoning besides the traffic cone that led to the triggered response that it made.",I am assuming that the AV has the ability to detect a moving pedestrian in its pathway because there are very limited alternatives that would explain why the AV made the decision to slow down and stop at that exact location. The av could have also detected the crosswalk label on the street and made the decision to slow down.,"The reasoning for stopping at that exact location is unknown, as the cyclists and pedestrian concepts weren't triggered as detectable. So now I'm more confident that the av may not stop due to a cyclist or pedestrian in its pathway. Maybe it detected and responded to an object in the pathway."
5e2c7806bb1a6e000cf7f2e8,"I am confused about this one as I will ever be, but I think because of the cars to the right it stopped, so I don't think it would've changed if it was slightly to the left",The AV would've stop regardless if it were slightly to the left ,"I think it would've continued driving as normal, but due to the cone being detected in its path the AV stopped.","The traffic cone was in the AV path, therefor the AV stooped to avoid colliding with the cone.","It's most likely that the AV will do the same thing in the future, slow down because it detects a cyclist ","I trust that the AV will do the same in the future, it knows that it's a cyclist near by."
652359572fd30ff57dfea7fb,"I don't think the AV would keep moving forward because pedestrians could cross the parking lot near the pick-up zone.  So, the pedestrians might not stay completely in the zone.","The AV did not state that it detected a pickup zone.  It stated that it detected close vehicles.  So, I'm somewhat concerned it might have kept driving if it was slightly to the left.","If there was no cone, there would be no obstruction.  So, I think the AV would have kept moving forward.","The AV would have not have kept moving forward because the cone was directly in front of it.  But, the AV did not even detect it.

So, I feel pretty confident it would detect future cyclists and stop and wait for them to cross too.",I feel somewhat confident the AV will not detect a future cyclist because the current cyclist is moving back and forth next to the crosswalk.  There's no reason the AV should not have detected him.
62b9e94484e7ffb27d90f991,I think it would stop because of its technology it has and it's supposed to stop just like a human would ,The ai would stop since it stopped at the right side because of the parked cars close by,The ai would keep going because there was nothing else in the way accept parked cars on the right side ,The ai would stop because it thought a vehicle was ahead of it ,I think the ai would stop because of the people on a bike and I think it would detect them cyclists,The ai would stop because of the cyclists or pedestrians are that close to the vehicle or at a stop light Also

Although, there were no pedestrians present, so it is a little odd to stop for no one.",So the vehicle's actions had nothing to do with the pedestrian drop off zone.  It stopped because there was a car sticking out from it's space.,I believe the car detected an object in front of it and that is why it stopped.  ,"The vehicle alerted to the fact that there was an object in front of it.

Based on the vantage point of the clip, It appears that the vehicle stopped due to coming close to the parked vehicles.",I feel that the EV would have continued moving if it had been to the left since the reason for it stopping was due to close proximity to the parked vehicles on the right which was reflected by The concepts detected in the clip.,I felt that the EV stopping in the second club had nothing to do with the traffic cone because it stopped much farther before approaching the traffic on than in the first clip.,The traffic cone appeared to not play a role in the vehicle stopping in the second clip since it stopped a lot sooner before approaching the traffic on the end the first clip. The vehicle comes very close to the traffic cone in the first clip.,The vehicle stopping appeared to be due detection of the cyclist in the road. The stopping did not seem random or for some emergency reason.,In this clip it appears that the vehicle slowed down for some type of emergency reason since there were no detections of the cyclist in the concepts shown.
5fd6f3d6d15e6e6631abd0f1,"Although I am not very sure/confident, I would assume that the vehicle would not stop if it were farther from the pick up spot simply because it would be inconvenient if it did.

Although it may assume that it is another vehicle, it doesn't really matter what the object is. If it did not stop for any object in it's path, this would be unsafe.","Although the AV did appear to stop because of the bike, the biker was moving back and forth, partially in the road. This means that the AV may have stopped because it detected a bike in the road, and may not detect them otherwise. I also happen to have little trust in an AV regardless of how it is programmed, and would never fully trust one.","Because the bike was moving back and forth into the road, it is hard to determine how well it would detect one in a different scenario.
