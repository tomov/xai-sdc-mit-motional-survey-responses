While this is an experimental AV, it must possess fundamental perception and control loop logic to detect stationary or slow-moving obstacles in its immediate path, like a traffic jam, and command a full stop. If the system's ""drive straight"" command failed to be overridden by a ""stop for obstacle"" command in the presence of a completely blocked path, it would represent a catastrophic failure of the most basic safety layer, rendering it a non-functional system. Therefore, I predict it would have correctly stopped.",1,7,2,7,"The explanation confirms that the AV's behavior is driven by specific, detected concepts. The car was driving straight because it perceived the road geometry as straight and, critically, the path ahead was clear. A traffic jam constitutes a major change in the environment, causing the system's perception module to fail its check for a clear path. The concept that was green to allow forward movement would become inactive, and a new, high-priority concept like 'Obstacle/Stopped Vehicle Ahead' would become active. In any safety-critical software system, the module that detects and avoids a collision-risk obstacle must have the highest priority, overriding the simple 'Drive Straight' logic and executing a full stop. The concept-based architecture confirms this modular safety logic is in place.",2,4,1,7,"The car stopped because the parked cars on the right narrowed the available lane width to a point where the system's safety margin was likely violated, or it detected insufficient lateral clearance. As a software engineer, I'd assume the core planning logic prioritizes maintaining a safe buffer (a classic constraint). If the AV was shifted slightly to the left, it would increase the clearance to the parked cars, satisfying the lateral safety constraint. Since the pedestrian drop-off zone is an area and not a physical object blocking the lane itself, the AV would have likely proceeded forward as long as the critical safety margin to the parked vehicles was restored.",1,7,2,7,"The concept-based explanation proved the 'Approaching Pedestrian Zone' is the primary causal factor for the stop, not the physical proximity to the parked cars on the right. Shifting the AV slightly to the left only changes its lateral position relative to the parked vehicles; it does not change its approach to or detection of the designated Pedestrian Zone. Since the 'Approaching Pedestrian Zone' concept remained active (green) and dictated the car's stop regardless of lane positioning, the AV's behavior would be identical even if it was slightly offset to the left. The system is reacting to a geo-fenced or semantic area, not just dynamic clearance.",1,4,1,7,"The first clip shows the car driving forwards without issue in the same general environment (a clear lane).

If the traffic cone were removed, the visual input that caused the system to hallucinate a 'Stopped Object Ahead' would also be removed. Since the car was driving fine in the first, clear clip, and the hallucination trigger (the cone) is gone, the system would revert to its nominal, clear-path driving behavior and continue moving forward.",1,4,2,3,"The primary issue in this experimental AV is one of generalizability and robust object recognition, which is a common challenge in the field. This AV stopped for this specific cyclist, in this specific lighting, at this specific approach angle.

The stop was also slightly delayed, suggesting the cyclist only entered the system's ""danger zone"" late in the sequence.",1,7,1,7,"The concept-based explanation dramatically increases my confidence. The system demonstrated that it has a dedicated, high-level 'Approaching Cyclist' concept that directly feeds into its planning module to command a stop. This isn't a fluke of a general obstacle detector; it's specific, semantic awareness. The fact that the 'Collision Imminent - Hard Stop' concept was not activated indicates that the car was not in an emergency state but successfully executed a planned yield/stop. Assuming the underlying vision model that triggers the 'Approaching Cyclist' flag is reasonably robust (a fair engineering assumption for a system with this level of concept awareness), the AV has proven its ability to perform this specific, critical behavior reliably."

It would make no sense for any company to not include this rule, for them it would be a huge liability.",1,1,1,1,"Although I am not very sure/confident, I would assume that the vehicle would not stop if it were farther from the pick up spot simply because it would be inconvenient if it did. If the vehicle were programmed to stop no matter what at every pick up spot, that would be a huge hassle for the drivers.",2,4,1,4,"If the vehicle stopped because it was too close to the parked cars, then it only makes sense that it would not stop if it were further away from the parked cars.",1,4,1,4,"I believe that if there is nothing to block the path of the vehicle, or indicate that it is unsafe to proceed, then it would continue to move forward because not doing so would cause a lot of inconvenience for drivers.",1,4,1,4,"It would be dangerous for the AV to not stop if another object was detected in it's way. Although it may assume that it is another vehicle, it doesn't really matter what the object is. If it did not stop for any object in it's path, this would be unsafe.",1,4,2,4,"Although the AV did appear to stop because of the bike, the biker was moving back and forth, partially in the road. This means that the AV may have stopped because it detected a bike in the road, and may not detect them otherwise. I also happen to have little trust in an AV regardless of how it is programmed, and would never fully trust one.",1,4,2,4,"Because the bike was moving back and forth into the road, it is hard to determine how well it would detect one in a different scenario. Plus, as previously stated, I do not trust an AV 100% in any situation."
