I'm certain an AV that is on public roads would have been able to detect vehicles ahead and slow down accordingly ,1,7,1,7,Having reasonings present makes me more confident that the AV will be able to detect and stop for vehicles. The intentions are displayed and it's selection is clear ,2,4,1,5,"It looked like the white honda accord was sticking out a little bit. Unsure of the reasoning, but I don't think it had anything to do with the pedestrian zone ",2,7,1,7,"The reasoning is that we are too close to the actor vehicle, so in theory by being more left we should not be as close",1,5,1,6,"Looks like the cone is right infront of the AV, thereby obstructing the path",2,5,1,5,"This one was a little bit confusing, as per the reasoning it is saying we are approaching a stopped vehicle.

",1,7,2,6,The green indicator confirmed my believe that the AV was driving straight due to the detection of a straight road. There was no detection of a stopped vehicle ahead of us leading me to believe that the AV is at least capable of seeing a stopped vehicle ahead. Based on my experience with our cars I would be very confident that AV would stop if it did encounter stopped vehicles up ahead. I am almost always reluctant to put extremely confident because these are test vehicles at the end of the day. ,2,6,1,5,"The pedestrian pick up zone is much further ahead than where the AV stopped and there were no pedestrians present in the video leading me to believe that it is much more likely that the AV was reacting to the parked vehicles on the right that were sticking out a little farther than normal causing the AV to get stuck. Im very confident that this is the case. I am a little less confident that if the AV was slightly to the left it would have kept on going. I assume this is the case, but I have no way of seeing what Av was anticipating the parked vehicle to do. Slightly to the left is also pretty vague and subjective. If the AV was an inch to the left it may have had a similar reaction, but 8 inches to the left the Av probably would have continued on its intended path.  ",2,7,1,5,"After watching the video it is clear that the AV stopped due to being to close to the parked vehicle. Again I can not say with certainty that the AV would have continued on its path if it was slightly to the left without seeing the viewer app, but I would assume that if the Av was slightly to the left it would have continued on its original path. ",1,7,1,7,The AV clearly stopped due to the cone in front of it. I have no reason to believe that the AV would have stopped otherwise. None of the cars on the right were sticking out too far and the road was completely clear. ,1,7,1,7,It is clear in the video that the AV was perceiving the cone as a parked vehicle and it came to a stop because of that. If the cone was moved the Av would no longer have detected a stopped vehicle and would have continued on its intended path. I can say this with close to absolute certainty. ,1,7,1,6,"The AV clearly stopped because it was detecting the cyclist. I am confident that the Av would stop in a similar situation but due to my own paranoia I would not put extremely confident because the stakes are very high when dealing with cyclists and I never assume that the vehicle is going to do what it is supposed to do in these situations. That being said, in nearly all of the interactions like this that I have experienced, the AV would come to a stop or slow down for the cyclist. ",1,6,1,6,"I am slightly less confident in my original answer due to the cyclist indicator not lighting up, however I still believe the AV stopped due to the cyclist but maybe categorized the cyclist as a generic object. I still think the AV would slow down or stop if this situation was replicated in the future.  "
